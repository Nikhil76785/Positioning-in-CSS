        <h1>Coding</h1>
        <div class="div">Coding can be defined as writing instructions for computers and other hardware. The computer is then able to read the
        instructions (called “programs”) and do what you have asked it to do.</div><br>

        <div class="diva">In the previous section, we saw that the terms “coding” and “programming” can be used interchangeably. This is because
        both involve writing programs.
        
        The two terms, however, differ in terms of their scope. In addition to writing code, a programmer is also involved in
        high-level problem-solving.
        
        For example, a programmer might advise on the technologies that should be used in a project. This is because they have
        things like security and scalability in mind.
        
        A coder’s responsibility, on the other hand, will involve writing code that results in a certain user story being
        fulfilled.</div>
        
        <div class="divf">Technology has permeated every aspect of our lives. You can order your favorite meal via a mobile app, transfer money
        from the comfort of your home, and switch your lights on and off from your phone—even when you’re not home.
        
        At the core of all this technological advancement is coding. Teams of developers, designers, coders, and programmers
        work together to build this software that makes our lives so convenient.</div><br>
        
        <div class="divs">It’s quite difficult to come across a company, organization, or industry where coding isn’t used.
        
        All the big tech companies—Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and Apple (known as MANGA, MAANG, or MAGNA)—use code.</div><br>

        <div class="divr">As we have seen in the previous section, coding is really quite significant in almost every part of our daily lives and
        how we go about our business.
        
        But in what other ways is coding important to learn?</div><br>
